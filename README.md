## Overview

Welcome to the **Interpreter Language** project! 🚀 This is a simple interpreter designed to evaluate basic mathematical expressions and handle string literals. The interpreter processes input strings by tokenizing them, parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and evaluating the AST to produce results. 

## Features 🌟

- **Tokenization**: Converts input strings into recognizable tokens (numbers, operators, parentheses).
- **Parsing**: Transforms tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **Evaluation**: Computes mathematical expressions and concatenates string literals.
- **Error Handling**: Catches and reports errors for invalid expressions.

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.12.7**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interpreter-language.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd interpreter-language
Usage
To use the interpreter, run the main script:


python interpreter.py
You can enter mathematical expressions and string literals, and the interpreter will return the evaluated result. For example:


> 2 + 3 * (4 - 1)
Result: 11

> "Hello, World!" + " How are you?"
Result: "Hello, World! How are you?"

> 42 / 0
Error: Division by zero! Even the universe has its limits. 😅
Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:


python -m unittest discover -s tests
